Instructions how to run projekat_2
I made it in Visual Studio 2019 and the database is in the folder under the name "tvpbaza.mdb". The string connection path is not relative so it needs to be added manually
In Visual Studio 2019 in the Solution Explorer "tvpbazaDataSet.xsd" must be deleted first, and added under the same name. The procedure is as follows: 
Open Project>Add New Data Source> Database then Next> Dataset then Next> New Connection> Browse then select the database file, test connection to check if everything is ok 
then you can press ok> Next> NO > check 'Tables' then set DataSet name to "tvpbazaDataSet">Finish and then everything should work normally
